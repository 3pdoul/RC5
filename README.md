# RC5
AVR assembly program to code RC5.
RC5 is designed by Rivest, which is a symmetric-key block cipher notable for its simplicity
(http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/Riv94.pdf). A key feature of RC5 is the heavy use of data-
dependent rotations. RC5 has a variable word size, a variable number of rounds, and a variable
length secret key.

The project provide the implementation of RC5 in AVR assembly and C language for more verification.
